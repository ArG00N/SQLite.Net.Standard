This is a .NET console App. 
It references the SQLite.Net.Standard NuGet package.
To make changes in the core library,  drop the NuGet reference and add a reference to the SQLite.Net.Standard directly

If you switch to a 64 but version of the app, you must repoint the sqlite3.dll to the 64 bit version.
